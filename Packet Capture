We captured this traffic. Can you find anything interesting? Tip: You are NOT looking for text in the packet capture.

I opened the file packet-capture.pcapng with wireshark.
I then went to file, export object and clicked on HTTP.
In the text filter/search bar I entered flag and three items popped up.
I saved each file and into my kali and ran them.
the file named possibly_a_flag was the correct file where I was able to retreive the flag.
