We intercepted traffic of a cybercriminal downloading malware onto a victim's computer. We have the network signature of the file, but we do not know where exactly this criminal copied the file. Based on logs, we know it is one of the files contained in this directory. The hash of the downloaded malware is 6859e1d10d08c1ea91f6e53ba6d601149b08d4efab8f8c2d586f6858ae1773a7. Find the file that matches this match. The flag is FS{filenam} where filename is the name of the malware file.
1. You really should automate this process. Looking for that file hash manually would take forever.
2. You can read a file as bytes in python and pass that entire file into hashlib with f.read().
3. Solving this challenge is even easier if you just write a bash script.
