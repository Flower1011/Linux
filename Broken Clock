They say even a broken clock is right twice a day, but I prefer to only be right once! I also know what my favorite time to be stuck at would be. Schedule broken-clock to run every day at 1:37 PM from your favorite, world-write directory (cough/tmpcough). Instead of waiting ALL DAY for this magical time, simply run the binary to confirm you scheduled it correctly and receive the flag.

NOTE: Don't change the binary name - broken-clock so is awesome who would want to change is anyways?

(cp broken-clock /tmp/
crontab
sudo chmod +x broken-clock
./broken-clock)

wget broken-clock
crontab -e
37 13 * * * /tmp/broken-clock
chmod +x broken-clock
./broken-clock
