Now that the ssh server is running, let's make it's login more secure. Modify the ssh config to allow only key-based authentication (no password). Create a public/private key pair named ssshhh_rsa with a blank passphrase (make sure the private key is accessable in ~/.ssh). Finally, add the public key to kali's authorized_keys. Once complete, run ssshhh-2 to verify these steps and receive the flag.

Note: You should run ssshhh-2 as root but, from whatever user you run this binary, that user must have the ssshhh_rsa private key in ~/.ssh.

Disable SSH password authentication in /etc/ssh/sshd_config change the following options to no:
       ChallengeResponseAuthentication
       PasswordAuthentication
       UsePAM
Use generate keys with ssh-keygen.
sudo ssh-keygen -t rsa
enter ssshhh_rsa for the name
leave passphrase blank by pressing enter only
cat ssshhh_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_hosts
mv ssshhh_rsa ~/.ssh
wget URL
chmod u+x ssshhh-2
su root
./ssshhh-2
