It's time to play hide-and-go-seek! An executable named where-am-i is hiding somewhere. Can you determine its location without using locate or find? The flag is hidden in the same directory as the real where-am-i (there is an imposter).

which where-am-i
cd /usr/local/sbin/
ls
cat secret.txt (wrong secret file)
whereis where-am-i
cd /usr/local/bin/
ls
cat secret.txt (right secret file)
FS{Where_is_it...Now_I_get_it!}
