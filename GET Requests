The site http://shell.fullstackacademy.com:60031 only accepts HTTP GET requests. Send it a request that includes all three of the below paramater:value pairs to get the flag.

usertype:admin
school:fullstack cyber bootcamp
access-level:super duper top secret

I used https://hoppscotch.io/ to send a GET request and input the Parameter and Value pairs in the designated areas.
I recieved RlN7cmVhbGx5X3Nob3VsZF9ub3RfdXNlX3F1ZXJ5X3BhcmFtc190b19hdXRoZW50aWNhdGV9
and decoded from base64
echo "RlN7cmVhbGx5X3Nob3VsZF9ub3RfdXNlX3F1ZXJ5X3BhcmFtc190b19hdXRoZW50aWNhdGV9" | base64 -d
