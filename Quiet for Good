This is a bonus problem.
It is quiet... for now. I am so afraid that noise will come back. It seems to reappear everytime I [re]start my day. Can you ensure I am rid of it for good? Run quiet-for-good to test if the noise is gone ... for good.

cd ..
cd ..
ls -a
nano .bashrc
#buzz init
pgrep buzz
ps aux | grep buzz
which buzz
sudo mv /usr/sbin/buzz /usr/sbin/buzz.txt
chmod +x quiet-for-good
sudo rm /usr/sbin/buzz.txt
./quiet-for-good
