Execute logging and capture it's traffic. Figure out what the client is doing and then do the same yourself to get the flag.

I opened the file logging with wireshark to capture the traffic
i clicked capture and used eth0 interface and hit start to capture traffic
I then went into my kali and entered ./logging
I went back to wireshark and then stopped capture
I noticed packet 94 was highlighted in red and then I clicked follow TCP stream
I saw the clue for listening and then used netcat on the IP address and port number given in packet 94
netcat 52.1.103.48 60032 
After running that command it asked for an access code and I found it inside of the follow TCP stream for packet 94 which was "following_the_green_machine"
After entering the access code I was given a list of numbered options to choose from 
I chose 3 because that option gives me the flag.
